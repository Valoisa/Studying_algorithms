# Studying_algorithms
This repository contains several projects, in which some algorithms are implemented.

*Sorting*:
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Counting inversions with the help of merge sort

*Fast Mult*:
* Number template class, represents the long number
* Long add, sub, mult
* Karatsuba multiplication

*Strassen*
* Matrix template class
* Matrix addition subtraction, straight-forward multiplication
* Strassen mutiplication

Also there are some important data structures implementation.
*Binary heap*:
* Insert O(log n)
* GetMin/GetMax O(1)
* DelMin/DelMax O(log n)

*Binary Search Tree*:
* Insert: avg O(lon n), worst O(n)
* Remove: avg O(log n), worst O(n)
* Search: avg O(log n), worst O(n)
* Traverse: O(n)

*AVL-Tree*
* Insert O(log n)
* Remove O(log n)
* Search O(log n)
* Traverse O(n)
